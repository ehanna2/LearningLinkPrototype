Overview:
This program serves as the Architectural Prototype for our final project.

It demonstrates the use case of a student registering for a course. For this demo
we assume that the student is logged in and has found the course they want to add. We
also assume that the student has completed the Prerequisites. Please note that, in this 
prototype, some datatypes have been changed for simplicity from the class diagram. 
Additionally, the Driver class is used to accomplish the functionality of CourseRegistration.

How to run the demo:
Run Driver.java as a java project.

Observe information for the course, Calculus II is printed. Note there are initially
no students enrolled.

Observer information for the student, Mary, is printed. Note the student is initially
enrolled in no courses.

When prompted, press Enter to register the student in the course.

Observe information for the course is printed again. Now Mary is listed as enrolled.

Observe information for the student is printed again. Now Calculus II is listed as a 
course the student is enrolled in.
